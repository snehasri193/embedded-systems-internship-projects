# 🔌 Embedded Systems Internship – Arduino Projects

This repository contains the **Arduino and Embedded C projects** I developed during my **Embedded Systems Internship** under the subject *Embedded Systems*.

## 🧠 Overview
These projects demonstrate the implementation of microcontroller-based applications using **ATmega328P (Arduino Uno)**.  
All circuits were simulated and tested on **Tinkercad Circuits**.

## 📂 Projects

| Project No. | Title | Description | Key Concepts |
|--------------|--------|--------------|---------------|
| 1 | 7-Segment Display Counter | Displays numbers from 00 to 99 using multiplexed 7-segment displays | Multiplexing, Timers, Display Control |
| 2 | LED Control using Serial and Switch | Control an LED using both a pushbutton and serial monitor | Digital I/O, Serial Communication |
| 3 | LED Pattern using Registers | LED pattern sequencing using direct register access | Low-Level AVR Register Programming |

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Tinkercad Circuits** – Circuit simulation  
- **Arduino IDE** – Code development and testing  
- **Microcontroller:** ATmega328P  
- **Language:** Embedded C / Arduino Framework  

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Understanding of input/output pin configuration  
- Implementation of serial communication  
- Using registers for low-level control  
- Real-time simulation of embedded systems
